I am working my way through the (excellent) text [Forecasting: principles and practice](http://otexts.org/fpp/), written by [R. Hyndman](http://robjhyndman.com/) and G. Athanasopoulos.   
The sample code and exercises provided in the text, combined with the **R [forecast](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/index.html) **package offers an infinite opportunity to test and examine time series data in simple but revealing ways.  In order to ease that exploration, this interactive tool implements some of the examples from Chapter 8.  Specific functions implemented here are:   
- [Stationarity and Differencing](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8/1)   
- Autocorrelation function estimation   
- [Seasonal](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8/9) and [Non-seasonal](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8/5) ARIMA models
